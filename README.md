# HomeFramework
You've nothing but the clothes on your back, and you're moving into a new home. What do you need in your everyday life?


## Furniture
 - Cushions
 - Chairs
 - Tables
    - Living Room Table // obtained first, is cheapest and easiest, has most individual uses, especially with cushions (you can eat and sleep on it) /m
    - Dining Table
    - Bedside Table 
 - Fans
 - Lamps

## Kitchen + Cooking

 - Knifes // first cooking implement - also first tools.
    - Pairing/Petty Knife // A knife used to cut or peel things in the hand. Can also be used with cutting board. /m
        - // Can be used as first knife in Tools, and visa versa -> this is a bad hygiene practice /m
    - Cutting Board Knife // prototypical 'big knife' for doing most kitchen tasks. Only need One. /m 
        -  French Chef's Knife // if you have worked in a kitchen /m
        -  Santoku // As versatile as French chef's, generally safer, especially when used right. Not as fast (but home cooks don't need to be fast) /m 
            - // They sell small versions of these, those are less useful. Get the biggest one you are comfortable handling /m
        - Chinese Chef's Knife // Most different on this list, primary extra utility is that it can be used as a scoop for food. /m
        - Gyuto // Is used like a Santoku, with the speed and utility of a French Chef's knife. /m
    - Kitchen Shears // stupidly useful for things like herbs and minor butchery. Make sure to get the sort that can be taken apart for sanitizing. 

 - Pans 
    - Skillet // Endless debate on this one. Probably should be first pan you get. Sizing should be considered for the number of people you are cooking for, too much pan is a bad thing. /m
        - Nonstick // my personal bugabo. I don't like things that degrade over time, and I have never used them. low fat cooking needs them tho. /m
        - Carbon Steel // a lighter Cast Iron - lasts forever - takes less gas to heat up, think less about heat retention ( a hot cast iron will keep cooking things for a min after taking off heat) /m
        - Cast Iron // a heavier Carbon Steel - lasts forever - Holds more heat, and puts it in food more efficiently. Better in the oven then Carbon Steel, but harder on the range.  
        - Stainless // Would be my second skillet, sometimes you need something to stick. The amount of money you put into them matters, due to complex manufacturing. /m
        - Enamel Cast Iron // very expensive, equal too or less than the $20 pan /m
        - "Ceramic" Pan // it's an Aluminum pan with Enamel on it. While cute, I haven't heard good things about their heat transfer properties. /m 
    - Sauce Pan // I have had very good luck with Tramontina pans - I see no reason not to get stainless with these /m
        -  1 qt // oatmeal sized -- great for small portions 
        -  1.5 qt // a large size when cooking for one /m  
        -  2 qt // standard but a bit much if you are cooking for one 
        -  4 qt // I would buy multiple 2 qt and the stock pot before one of these
        -  Stock Pan // Sometimes you just need to boil gallons and gallons of water. You won't know you need it until you do. /m
    - Universal // pan/pot that can do everything, everywhere, all at once. A skillet would still be first on my list. /m
        - Dutch Oven // Slightly wins out in universal qualities, the Wok needs directional flame, you can throw a dutch over in a pit of coals and cook /m
        - Wok  // Get this and only this if you are looking to do Chinese cuisine. Needs research to use right, but it's nearly as versatile as the dutch oven. Rounded bottom is better /m 
        - Karahi // India's universal pot, comparable to wok /m 
    - Sheet Pan // these are sized based on baker's sheets, can be supplemented with Cast Iron/Carbon Steel/Dutch Oven 
        - 2/3s // big sheet meals   
        - Half // small sheet meals
        - Quarter // finding these in bulk is great for ingredient prep around the kitchen /m
        - Eighth // Even more useful as trays in kitchen, can also be used as plates. /m
    - Griddle // griddle's are a useful supplement to a Skillet, especially for making flatbreads like pancakes or tortilla. /m
        - Electric // most people know these, can be a great extra cooking surface during very large cooking sessions. Have burned down many houses. /m 
        - Steel // not necessarily cheaper then electric, requires even heating, thicker is better. Less likely to burn your house down. The thicker ones can be used as a pizza steel /m
    - Casserole dish // cuisine specific, can use a dutch oven for this. They are endless at the thrift /m


 - Utility
    - Surface food scraper // hands are flawed instruments for getting stuff off a surface and into a dish. /m
